'@lblod/ember-rdfa-editor-lblod-plugins': patch
---

Slightly readjust styling of `snippet` and `structure` nodes, to ensure better cursor behaviour in firefox.
Note: for the better cursor behaviour in firefox to work as expected, `@lblod/ember-rdfa-editor` version [12.8.0](https://github.com/lblod/ember-rdfa-editor/releases/tag/%40lblod%2Fember-rdfa-editor%4012.8.0) or higher needs to be installed.
